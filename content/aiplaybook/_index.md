## To create a shelf of AI APIs or to use an off-the-shelf AI API?

If you're an AI startups, you evaluate the choices for AI infrastructure frequently (and if you do not, you should):

- Should you invest in up-front cost to create custom model

### OR

- Should you plug in an applied AI api?

Oftentimes you evaluate when to make the switch from one choice to another. This guidebook intends to make that choice a bit easier, and future-proof.

AI APIs, like [OpenAI APIs](https://openai.com/api/ "OpenAI APIs"), or [Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/#api "Azure Cognitive Services") (like Speech, Language, Vision, Decision, Cognitive Search, Bot Service) can help spin industry-best models through a simple API calls needing low to no maintenance on creatorâ€™s end.

Adapting an open-source model can help train your own model, thereby having end-to-end control over what you're creating.

**However, most industry-best models allow for customization, and sometimes you do not need the industry-best performance. This guidebook will help you make the best decisions based upon this tradeoff and showcase of successful use-cases from your peer startups.**
