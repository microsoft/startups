## To create a shelf of AI APIs or to use an off-the-shelf AI API?

Whether you’re a gaming startup making your character talk, or you’re creating a translation product with industry specific entity recognition, you evaluate the choices for AI infrastructure frequently.

> Should you create a custom model and train your model with available or synthetic data?

OR

> Should you get started with an applied AI API and customize it for your solution?

While custom models are the default answers for a lot of startups, oftentimes, those decisions are made without considering applied AI APIs as a feasible alternative. However, as we work with startups, we observe that the startups that leveraged applied AI service (like [Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/#api) (like Speech, Language, Vision etc) or [OpenAI APIs](https://openai.com/api/)) ended up saving upfront investment and gained on their ability to prioritize innovation with that time and money.

Along with industry leading performance that these APIs bring, they also achieve MVP phase quicker, thereby going moving from experimentation to production rapidly

**Applied AI APIs are the differentiators** that can help startups build an AI infrastructure that’ll automatically bring new or updated capabilities to their doorstep (e.g., another language support in Language Translation). 

Their customization features like [Custom NER](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/custom-named-entity-recognition/overview) and [Custom Neural Voice](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/custom-neural-voice) can help bridge the gap between industry innovation and rapid production.
