## Put it in a container

The first step to getting our app into the cloud is packaging it up. We want to take your application, and everything it needs to run – libraries, binaries etc. – and run it somewhere.

Being packaged in a container means your application runs in a consistent, isolated way wherever you put it. It also means you have a single unit which you can test and know works together.

This guide is not an in-depth technical look at containers, how they work and all those technical details. If you're interested in that kind of detail, Brian Holt has a great [introduction to containers](https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-containers/intro) which we think you'll enjoy!
