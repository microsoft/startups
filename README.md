# Startups guide to Azure
This repo provides startups with Azure guidance, information, and resources. Whether you're creating something brand new, you're considering a move from another cloud provider, you want to leverage Azure services, you're refactoring your architecture, or you're throwing everything away and starting over, this guide will help you.

## Get started with Azure
You can quickly get started with Azure by [creating a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/). The free account includes access to 25 different products that are always free. You also get free access to popular Azure products for 12 months. And you get a $200 credit to spend in the first month. For the latest details on the free Azure account, consult the [Azure Free Account FAQ](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/free-account-faq/).

If you already have an Azure subscription, you don't need to create a new account.

## What does Azure have to offer?
Azure has a broad range of products that cover many different scenarios, capabilities, and needs.

With a free account, you get access to two tiers of products, *free* and *free for 12 months*:

- [Products that are always free](azure-products-free.md)
- [Products that are free for 12 months](azure-products-free-trial.md)

With an Azure subscription, you get access to all of the free products and the products that are pay-as-you-go. To help you make sense of it all, we've compiled a [curated list of products](azure-products.md) that we think are particularly relevant to startups.

## Learn about how to use Azure
With your Azure account created and a list of products you want to use in mind, it's time to learn about how to use them.

[Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/browse/?products=azure&resource_type=learning%20path) is a great resource for learning everything there is to know about Azure.
